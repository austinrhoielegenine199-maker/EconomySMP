## Punishment Exemption Permissions

Holding `/offend`, `/ban` or `/mute` says nothing about who the command may be used on, so a rank
handed one of those nodes can otherwise punish anybody on the server, the owner included. Give a rank
the exempt node and staff who lack the bypass are turned away instead.

| Permission Node | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `economysmp.admin.punishments.exempt` | `op` | The player cannot be punished. `/offend`, `/ban`, `/tempban`, `/mute`, `/tempmute`, `/vcmute`, `/warn`, `/kick` and `/blacklist` all refuse to touch them. |
| `economysmp.admin.punishments.exempt.bypass` | `op` | Punish players who hold the exempt node anyway. Give it to the ranks that are allowed to act on each other. |

Both nodes sit under `economysmp.admin.` rather than beside the other punishment nodes on
purpose. A server that hands its moderators `economysmp.staff.punishments.*` would otherwise
make every one of them unpunishable. `economysmp.admin.*` grants both, so an admin rank keeps
its protection and can still act on other admins.

The check reads the target's permissions off the player, which only works while they are online.
Punishing someone who is offline goes through as it always has, so an exempt player can still be
banned in absentia.

The refusal message is `PUNISHMENTS.TARGET-EXEMPT` in `messages.yml`.

## Spawner Permissions

| Permission Node | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `economysmp.spawner.bypass` | `false` | Break spawners without a Silk Touch pickaxe while `SETTINGS.REQUIRE_SILK_TOUCH` is enabled in `spawners.yml`. Registered with `default: false`, so operators do not receive it automatically. Assign it explicitly via LuckPerms. |
| `economysmp.command.spawner` | `true` | Reach `/spawner` at all. Every player has it, which is what makes `/spawner info` and `/spawner split` usable; the admin subcommands stay behind their own node. |
| `economysmp.admin.spawner` | `op` | Run `/spawner give`, `panel`, `reload`, `remove` and `forcebreak`, and see the full `/spawner info` breakdown on any spawner regardless of who owns it. |

---

## RTP Rank Permissions

These nodes are not registered in `plugin.yml` and are read straight off the player, so they work with
LuckPerms or any other permission plugin. Assign them per rank.

| Permission Node | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `economysmp.rtp.cooldown.<seconds>` | `false` | Override the `/rtp` cooldown for this player, in seconds. `economysmp.rtp.cooldown.3` gives a 3 second cooldown, and `economysmp.rtp.cooldown.0` removes the cooldown entirely. |
| `economysmp.rtp.priority.<weight>` | `false` | Position in the RTP waiting queue when all slots are busy. Higher weight is served first. |

When a player holds more than one cooldown node the **lowest** value wins, so stacked ranks always give
the player the fastest cooldown they are entitled to. A player with no cooldown node falls back to the
per-world `WORLD-SETTINGS.<world>.COOLDOWN` value in `rtp.yml`.

Named rank nodes can be mapped to a cooldown instead of using numeric nodes. See
`SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS.PERMISSIONS` in [Config-rtp.yml](Config-rtp.yml) — the shipped defaults map
`economysmp.rtp.cooldown.vip`, `.vip+` and `.vip++` to 15, 10 and 3 seconds.

Set `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS.ENABLED: false` in `rtp.yml` to ignore every cooldown permission and use
the per-world value for everyone.

---

## Home Limit Permissions

These nodes are not registered in `plugin.yml` and are read straight off the player, so they work with
LuckPerms or any other permission plugin. Assign them per rank.

| Permission Node | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `economysmp.homes.<1-100>` | `false` | How many homes the player may save. `economysmp.homes.10` allows ten homes. |
| `economysmp.homes.page.<1-100>` | `false` | The same limit expressed in menu pages, five homes each. `economysmp.homes.page.3` allows fifteen homes. |

When a player holds more than one node the **highest** value wins, so a player with both `.homes.5`
and `.homes.20` gets 20 homes, and mixing the two styles is fine — `.homes.page.2` and `.homes.12`
together give 12. A player with no home node falls back to `SETTINGS.HOME-DEFAULT` in `config.yml`,
which ships as 2.

The limit applies everywhere a home is created, so `/sethome`, the `/homes` menu and the Bedrock form
all stop at the same number, and the menu paginates to fit whatever the player is entitled to.

Wildcards do not grant a limit. `economysmp.*` leaves the player on `HOME-DEFAULT`, the same way
it does for `economysmp.enderchest.rows.<1-6>`, so a staff wildcard cannot quietly hand every
player 100 homes.

Named rank nodes can be mapped to a home count instead of using numeric nodes. See
`SETTINGS.HOME-PERMISSIONS.PERMISSIONS` in [Config-config.yml](Config-config.yml) — the shipped
defaults map `economysmp.homes.vip`, `.vip+` and `.vip++` to 5, 10 and 15 homes.

Set `SETTINGS.HOME-PERMISSIONS.ENABLED: false` in `config.yml` to ignore every home permission and
give everyone `HOME-DEFAULT`.

---

## Home & Team Blacklist Bypass Permissions

These nodes allow players (such as staff or administrators) to set personal homes or team homes in worlds excluded by `SETTINGS.HOME-EXCLUDED-WORLDS` or `TEAM.EXCLUDED-WORLDS` in `config.yml`.

| Permission Node | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `economysmp.homes.bypass` | `op` | Bypass personal home world exclusions (`/sethome`, `/homes` menu, Bedrock form) and arena restrictions. |
| `economysmp.teams.bypass` | `op` | Bypass team home world exclusions (`/team sethome`, `/team` menu, Bedrock form) and arena restrictions. |

---

## Ender Chest Size Permissions

These nodes are not registered in `plugin.yml` and are read straight off the player, so they work with
LuckPerms or any other permission plugin. Assign them per rank.

| Permission Node | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `economysmp.enderchest.rows.<1-6>` | `false` | Size of the player's Ender Chest, in rows. `economysmp.enderchest.rows.3` gives 27 slots, the same as a vanilla Ender Chest, and `economysmp.enderchest.rows.6` gives the full 54. |

One row is 9 slots, so the six tiers are 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 and 54 slots. When a player holds more than
one node the **highest** value wins, so a player with both `.rows.2` and `.rows.5` gets 45 slots. A
value above 6 is treated as 6. A player with no row node falls back to `ENDER-CHEST.DEFAULT-ROWS` in
`ender-chest.yml`, which ships as 6 — lower it if you want these permissions to hand out bigger chests
as a rank perk.

Wildcards do not grant a tier. `economysmp.*` leaves the player on the default size, the same way
it does for `economysmp.homes.<1-100>`, so a staff wildcard cannot quietly resize everyone.

Named rank nodes can be mapped to a row count instead of using numeric nodes. See
`ENDER-CHEST.ROW-PERMISSIONS.PERMISSIONS` in [Config-ender-chest.yml](Config-ender-chest.yml) — the
shipped defaults map `economysmp.enderchest.rows.vip`, `.vip+` and `.vip++` to 4, 5 and 6 rows.

Set `ENDER-CHEST.ROW-PERMISSIONS.ENABLED: false` in `ender-chest.yml` to ignore every row permission
and give everyone `DEFAULT-ROWS`.

---

## Auction Listing Limit Permissions

These nodes are not registered in `plugin.yml` and are read straight off the player, so they work with
LuckPerms or any other permission plugin. Assign them per rank.

| Permission Node | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `economysmp.auctionhouse.limit.<1-100>` | `false` | How many auctions the player may have active at once. `economysmp.auctionhouse.limit.15` allows fifteen listings. |
| `donutauction.limit.<1-100>` | `false` | The same limit under the short alias prefix, for servers carrying an older node layout. |

The number is a total, not a bonus added to the default. When a player holds more than one node the
**highest** value wins, so a player with both `.limit.10` and `.limit.25` gets 25. A player with no
limit node falls back to `SETTINGS.MAX_ACTIVE_LISTINGS_DEFAULT` in `auction-house.yml`, which ships as
5, and `/ah limit` prints a player's active count against whatever they are entitled to.

Wildcards do not grant a limit. `economysmp.*` leaves the player on `MAX_ACTIVE_LISTINGS_DEFAULT`,
the same way it does for `economysmp.homes.<1-100>`, so a staff wildcard cannot quietly hand every
player 100 listings.

Named rank nodes can be mapped to a listing count instead of using numeric nodes. See
`SETTINGS.MAX_ACTIVE_LISTINGS_BY_PERMISSION` in [Config-auction-house.yml](Config-auction-house.yml) — map a
node there to a negative number to give it unlimited listings.

---

## Media Rank & Badge Permissions

Media permissions are registered with `default: false` and require explicit assignment via LuckPerms (or explicit permission attachment). Being an OP player does not automatically grant media badge status.

| Permission Node | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `rank.media` | `false` | Display configurable Media tablist badge. Must be assigned explicitly via LuckPerms. |
| `rank.media.plus` | `false` | Display configurable Media+ tablist badge. Must be assigned explicitly via LuckPerms. |
| `rank.media.include` | `false` | Include player in media badge handling. Must be assigned explicitly via LuckPerms. |
